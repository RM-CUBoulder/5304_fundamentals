#### Background information
The data on which these charts are based are from a poll conducted among Americans before the elections of 2020. 
This poll was used for an article on the blog FiveThirtyEight

This survey is part of the final project for the course 'Fundamentals of Data Visualization' as part of the Master Data Science  
at the University of Colorado Boulder and has no relation to FiveThirtyEight.

#### Information about the charts
- Per income category every bar adds up to 100%.
- Naturally, the bigger the color, the bigger the share of the accompanying answer.
- By hovering over a single color you can see the answer it belongs to.

#### Goal
With this survey I set out to discover what information from these charts is most noticeable.
