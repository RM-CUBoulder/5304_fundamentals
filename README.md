#### Background information
The data on which these charts are based are from a poll conducted among Americans before the elections of 2020. 
This poll was used for an article on the blog FiveThirtyEight

This survey is for a study assigment and has no relation to FiveThirtyEight.

#### Information about the charts
- Per income category every bar adds up to 100%.
- Naturally, the bigger the color, the bigger the share of the accompanying answer.
- By hovering over a single color you can see the answer it belongs to.

#### Goal
With this survey I set out to discover what information from these charts is most noticeable.
